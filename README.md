git clone https://gitlab.com/ibdml/internship/-/blob/origin/all_pipeline_script.rmd
\`\`\`

## Configuration
Open the file and specify the path to your data file.

## Utilisation

To run the analysis pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Run the main script:
    new_script.rmd
2. The analysis pipeline begins by reading the DM data file, then performs normalization, filtering, profiling and functional enrichment steps.

3. The results will be saved in specific output files.
